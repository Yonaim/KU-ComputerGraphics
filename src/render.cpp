/*
– Write a ray tracer which generates eye rays through the center
of each pixel
– Calculates the intersection between each ray and each object in
the scene
– Also calculating the closest intersection (if any) for each ray.
– For each pixel, if the corresponding ray intersects an object, set
the pixel’s color to white; otherwise, set the pixel’s color to
black.
– See the Figure for a reference image.
